(** \defgroup out123_api out123 library API
 *  This is out123, a library focused on continuous playback of audio streams
 *  via various platform-specific output methods. It glosses over details of
 *  the native APIs to give an interface close to simply writing data to a
 *  file. There might be the option to tune details like buffer (period) sizes
 *  and the number of them on the device side in future, but the focus of the
 *  library is to ease the use case of just getting that raw audio data out
 *  there, without interruptions.
 *
 *  The basic idea is to create a handle with out123_new() and open a certain
 *  output device (using a certain driver module, possibly build-time defaults)
 *  with out123_open(). Now, you can query the output device for supported
 *  encodings for given rate and channel count with out123_get_encodings() and
 *  decide what to use for actually starting playback with out123_start().
 *
 *  Then, you just need to provide (interleaved pcm) data for playback with
 *  out123_play(), which will block when the device's buffers are full. You get
 *  your timing from that (instead of callbacks). If your program does the
 *  production of the audio data just a little bit faster than the playback,
 *  causing out123_play() to block ever so briefly, you're fine.
 *
 *  You stop playback with out123_stop(), or just close the device and driver
 *  via out123_close(), or even just decide to drop it all and do out123_del()
 *  right away when you're done.
 *
 *  There are other functions for specific needs, but the basic idea should be
 *  covered by the above.

 *  In other words: The kind of applications that out123 is designed for.
 *  This routine always kills off any currently active audio output module /
 *  device, even if you just disable the buffer when there is no buffer.
 *
 *  Keep this in mind for memory-constrainted systems: Activating the
